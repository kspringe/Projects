This program demonstrates how to correctly access and update
a shared variable across multiple concurrent threads.
It uses a mutex lock to control a critical region of code
that increments the shared variable. The use of the mutex lock
eliminates the race condition that is present without it.

The program creates one executable called increment and takes one
optional argument -n that specifies the number of concurrent
threads to run. Each thread executes 1000 shared variable increments.
